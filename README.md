# ECE369 Final Project
# FPGA based implementation of a full-scale pipeline data path and hands-on tradeoff analysis on the joint effects of the hardware, software, and instruction set architecture design realms on processor performance.
# Design and developed a five-stage pipeline processor for the MIPS 32-bit ISA.
# Conduct post-routing functional verification

# Final grade determined by 32 PRIVATE test cases.
# Final Grade: 31/32
